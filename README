Along with the Script Engine Plugin (available from <http://plugins.jedit.org/> or from jEdit's Plugin Manager), JRubyScriptEnginePlugin provides jEdit with the ability to use JRuby (as a JSR-223 scripting engine) to run buffers and implement macros.

To build, place JRuby's "complete" jar (e.g. jruby-complete-1.6.7.jar) in main/lib; the jar can be found at <http://www.jruby.org/download>. Then run ant as follows:

ant -Dbuild.support PATH-TO-JEDIT-BUILD-SUPPORT-DIR -Djedit.install.dir PATH-TO-JEDIT-INSTALLATION-DIR

The current version of this plugin uses JRuby 1.6.7. To use a different version, change the plugin.christopherson.eric.JRubyScriptEnginePlugin.jars property in main/resources/JRubyScriptEnginePlugin.props to reference the appropriate jar.

jEdit's build support dir is available from SVN at <https://jedit.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jedit/build-support/trunk>; . I'm not sure if it can be downloaded except from SVN.
