JRubyScriptEnginePlugin provides jEdit with the ability to use JRuby (as a JSR-223 scripting engine) to run buffers and implement macros.

To build, place JRuby's "complete" jar (tested with 1.6.7), along with ScriptEnginePlugin.jar and script-api.jar (both of which are from the ScriptEnginePlugin plugin), in main/lib. Then run ant as follows:

ant -Dbuild.support PATH-TO-JEDIT-BUILD-SUPPORT-DIR -Djedit.install.dir PATH-TO-JEDIT-DISTRIBUTION

jEdit's build support dir is available from SVN at https://jedit.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jedit/build-support/trunk . I'm not sure if it can be downloaded except from SVN.
