Along with the Script Engine Plugin (available from <http://plugins.jedit.org/> or from jEdit's Plugin Manager), JRubyScriptEnginePlugin provides jEdit with the ability to use JRuby (as a JSR-223 scripting engine) to run buffers and implement macros.

To build, install the Script Engine Plugin from the Plugin Manager. Then place JRuby's "complete" jar (e.g. jruby-complete-1.6.7.jar) in main/lib; the jar can be found at <http://www.jruby.org/download>. Then run ant as follows:

    ant -Djedit.install.dir=PATH-TO-JEDIT-INSTALLATION-DIR -Djedit.plugins.dir=PATH-TO-INSTALLED-PLUGIN-JARS

Alternately, put a file called <build.properties> in this plugin's root directory or the one just above it, and include the lines:

    jedit.install.dir=PATH-TO-JEDIT-INSTALLATION-DIR
    jedit.plugins.dir=PATH-TO-INSTALLED-PLUGIN-JARS

Then ant can be called without settings these two properties on the command line.

The current version of this plugin uses JRuby 1.6.7. To use a different version, change the plugin.christopherson.eric.JRubyScriptEnginePlugin.jars property in main/resources/JRubyScriptEnginePlugin.props to reference the appropriate jar.

jEdit's build support dir is available from SVN at <https://jedit.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jedit/build-support/trunk>; . I'm not sure if it can be downloaded except from SVN.
